Website: cuschedulebuilder.azurewebsites.net

The CU schedule builder scrapes https://apps.concord.edu/schedules/seatstaken.php every 5 minutes in order to update course data. The project consist of a front-end by means of HTML,CSS, jQuery, and DataTables. The back end consist of a MySQL database, A web-scraper built in python, and a PHP server processing script.

The process of events are as follows:
The webscraper constantly scrapes Concord's website every 5 minutes and updates the MySQL database.
The AJAX address in the front end tables.js file is set to the server side PHP script that queries the database.
The PHP script queries the database and returns the information via JSON format to the front end.
The front end receives this information and inserts it into a table that supports dynamic multi-column searching that does not require page refreshes
The courses offered table continues to be constantly updated every 5 minutes.
